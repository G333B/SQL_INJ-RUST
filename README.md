# SQL_INJ-RUST
The purpose of this project is to ***steal informations on OUR OWN web application using our own SQLi tool***.

Firstable, we had to create our website. 
We choose to create a small social network which allows users to post statuses and see other people statuses.

We used a rust based framework called Actix Web, a compilation system called Cargo and an ORM called Diesel.
These 3 tools allow us to develop a little web application very quickly.

Once done, we had to develop our tool using Rust. Its a small program which test few SQL injections on the website and extract informations. 
This tool also create a pdf that contains all infos.

We can go further and add a script which exploits XSS vulnerabilities. 

Let's see...
